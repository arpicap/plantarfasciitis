      My mom was diagnosed w plantar fasciitis a couple of years ago, a condition where there is pain in the heel of your foot, causing problems in walking and the way you walk as well.One day, she woke up to excruciating pain in her heel and bottom foot area.This made it extremely difficult for her to get up, walk, and do basic everyday activities.As a family, we would engage in hiking and outdoor activities, but after she was diagnosed, much of those activities came to a halt.<a href = "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plantar-fasciitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354846"><em>Click Here to Learn About Plantar Fasciitis</em></a>
